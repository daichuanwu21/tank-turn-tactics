# Tank Turn Tactics

A web implementation of the board game Tank Turn Tactics [originally prototyped at Halfbrick Studios](https://youtu.be/aOYbR-Q_4Hs). Reportedly, the game was so damaging to relationships between team members and, disruptive to productivity that it had to be banned.

So, uhh, is it a good idea to unleash this into a school? Only time will tell...

## Acknowledgements

The ruleset of this implementation was completely derived from the video. So huge thanks to the mates at Halfbrick Studios who came up with this horrifying system of play, and PMG for covering the story.
