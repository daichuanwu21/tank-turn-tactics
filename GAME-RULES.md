This file contains the rules for the variant of TTT this project targets; it's was largely copied from the [video @8:54](https://youtu.be/aOYbR-Q_4Hs?t=534).

### Rules

- All players start at a random location on the grid, and have 3 Health Points (HP) and 0 Action Points (AP).
- At a random time each day, each player will be given 1 AP.
- At any time you like, you can do one of the four following actions:
  1. Move to an adjacent, unoccupied square. (-1 AP)
  2. Shoot someone who is within your range, removing 1 HP from their health. (-1 AP)
  3. Add a heart to yourself. (-3 AP)
  4. Upgrade your range by 1. (-3 AP)
  5. Give someone within your range a health point. (-1 HP)
  6. Give someone within your range an action point. (-1 AP)
- At the start of the game, everyone has a range of 2. That is, they can shoot or interact with someone within 2 squares of them.
- If a player is reduced to 0 HP, they are dead. Any AP the dead player had are transferred to the player who killed them. Dead players remain on the board but do not receive the daily APs.
- Dead players can be given a health point. This will revive that player who will have 1 HP and 0 AP.

### Additional Stuff

- Everyone's AP count is secret! Probably a good idea to try and hide how many you have...
- The last player standing wins, so be careful who you form alliances with...
- You can't win this game without making some friends or stabbing some backs. Probably.

<!-- Not yet implemented -->
<!-- - Dead players form a jury. Each day they vote, and whoever receives most votes will be 'haunted', and not receive any AP points that day.
- Once a day, at a random time, a heart will spawn on the field. The first player to move into the square containing the heart will receive an additional heart. -->
